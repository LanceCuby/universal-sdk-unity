## Setting up your project

The Universal SDK for Unity provides an interface for using Universal SDK on either iOS or Android platform. To use Universal SDK in Unity Editor and export it to a platform, your development environment needs a few things.

### Unity requirements

+ Unity 2017.4 or later, with iOS and Android modules installed
+ A valid subscription for Unity Personal, Unity Plus, or Unity Pro

### Installation on iOS

To integrate Universal SDK for Unity on iOS, you need:

+ iOS 10.0 or higher as the deployment target
+ Xcode 10 or higher

On iOS, Universal SDK for Unity works as a wrapper for the Universal SDK for iOS Objc. You must use a manual to add the Universal SDK for iOS Objc to your project on iOS.

### Installation on Android

You must have the Android SDK installed, because Unity will use it to build your project to the Android platform. If you have previously [configured Unity for Android development (opens new window)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-sdksetup.html), you already have the Android SDK.
